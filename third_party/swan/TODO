1. angleInDegrees -> angle (radian)
2. glm::translate, rotate, order? in Camera 

3. project point and texture mapping

4. gl_PointSize

5. camera projection matrix depends on window width and height

6. model/camera rotate, translate, transform does not work as I thought!
   
7.  fix mode as camera

8. lessThan (glm/vector_relational.hpp)
9. all/any (gl/vector_relational.hpp)
   
10. draw camera

11. axes: 하나를 공유해서 다른 transformation으로 그리기
